# InstaS

This is Instagram clone made with php. It uses Javascript, php, html, css and bootstrap.

Instagram is socialmedia site that allows users to upload posts and for other users to like them. It also allows comments on posts and clipboard the current posts. You can view other profiles and their posts. Click on image opens modal window. 

Another major thing id regex with js that is used to display hashtags. The search for hashtags also works based on javascript regex. On profile under post description all hashtags are transformed into links and these links then search for all posts with that hashtag.
